## üìù Notes for Development Team

### Current Pain Points
1. **Bulk Upload**: Currently redirects to separate page - should be integrated
2. **Error Handling**: Needs improvement across all API calls
3. **Mobile Experience**: Works but could be optimized further
4. **Loading States**: Some operations lack visual feedback

### Quick Wins
1. Add loading spinners to all buttons during API calls
2. Implement proper form validation messages
3. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
4. Create help documentation/FAQ section

### Technical Considerations
1. Consider migrating to Next.js for better SEO and performance
2. Evaluate moving from Vercel Functions to Edge Functions
3. Implement proper state management (Redux/Zustand)
4. Add progressive web app (PWA) capabilities

## üö¶ Risk Mitigation
